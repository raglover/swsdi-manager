=== unicorn 6.0.0 - no more recycling Rack env / 2021-03-17 06:38 UTC

  This release allocates a new Rack `env' hash for every request.
  This is done for safety with internally-(thread|event)-using Rack
  apps which expect to use `env' after the normal Rack response is
  complete, but without relying on rack.hijack[1].  Thanks to
  Dirkjan Bussink <d.bussink@gmail.com> for the patch:

  The major version is bumped since:

  1) there are performance regressions for some simple Rack apps

  2) unsupported 3rd-party monkey patches which previously
     relied on this behavior may be broken (our version of
     OobGC was).

  The test suite is also more reliable on multi-core systems
  and Ruby 3.x.
