# SWSDI Manager
---
## Overview

This is an application for handling registration and camp management business for the Southwest Speech and Debate Institute. 

It has tools to manage applications, finances, and various reporting tools to make our jobs easier. We have successfull eliminated a huge amount of paperwork. 

More interesting stuff is still to come here, including instructions on how to use this thing. 

Future development will include a refactoring so that the app is more generic. As of this writing, some of the business logic is pretty specific to how we do things. I think this application could make a good scheduler/manager for all sorts of camps, so I'd like to maybe provide it SaaS style.
