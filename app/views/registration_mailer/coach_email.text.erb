Hello Coach <%= @user.coach_last %>!

Your student, <%= @user.first_name + " " + @user.last_name %> has 
registered to attend <%= @camp.name %> Speech and Debate Camp this 
summer. We are very excited to provide a great debate camp experience
for <%= @user.first_name %>. 

We wanted to send you an email to let you know about a couple of things:

First, in an effort to provide the best possible outcomes for our students,
we like to ask if the coach would provide any comments or recommendations
to help us effectively target those areas which will maximize the student's
success. 

If you would please download the form from this link: <%= @url %> fill it
out, and send it along to us, we would be grateful. You can fill it out
electronically, and email it back to us at info@swsdi.org, or you can 
mail it to the following address:

SWSDI
P.O. Box 25404
Tempe AZ, 85285

The second thing we wanted you to be aware of is that we offer a team discount.

If four or more of your students register to attend our camp by <%= @camp.discount_deadline %>,
then all of your campers will recieve a $100 discount off of the cost of tuition.

At SWSDI, we're interested in building competitors who not only take their 
competition seriously, but who take their roles in the community seriously. Our
students experience great competitive success, but they also build skills and
experience that helps them to take an active role in team leadership.

If you have any questions, please feel free to email us at info@swsdi.org, and one
of our staff members will get back to you as soon as possible.

Thank you for your time. We look forward to having <%= @user.first_name %> at
camp this summer!

Cheers,
The SWSDI Staff
