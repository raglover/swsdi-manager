Hello Coach <%= @user.coach_last %>!

Your student, <%= @user.first_name + " " + @user.last_name %> has 
registered to attend <%= @camp.name %> Speech and Debate Camp this 
summer. We are very excited to provide a great debate camp experience
for <%= @user.first_name %>. 

We wanted to send you an email to let you know about a couple of things:

First, in an effort to provide the best possible outcomes for our students,
we like to ask if the coach would provide any comments or recommendations
to help us effectively target those areas which will maximize the student's
success. 

If you would please visit the form at this link: <%= @url %>, fill it
out, and send it along to us, we would be grateful. 

The second thing we wanted you to be aware of is that we are offering discounts for students who made elimination rounds at the ASU HDSHC Invitational in 2021. If the student made elimination rounds, they are entitled to a 33% discount on tuition. If the student was a finalist, they are entitled to a 50% discount. If a student from your team made elims or finals, but will not be coming to SWSD this year, those discounts can be transferred. Please contact Richie at info@swsdi.org with the name of the student who will be recieving the discount, and the name of the student who will be transferring the discount. A discount code will then be emailed to the student for use when paying via credit card on ASU's QuickPay system. 

At <%= @camp.name %>, we're interested in building competitors who not only take their 
competition seriously, but who take their roles in the community seriously. Our
students experience great competitive success, but they also build skills and
experience that helps them to take an active role in team leadership.

If you have any questions, please feel free to email us at info@swsdi.org, and one
of our staff members will get back to you as soon as possible.

Thank you for your time. We look forward to having <%= @user.first_name %> at
camp this summer!

Cheers,
The SWSD Staff
