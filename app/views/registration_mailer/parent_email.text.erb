Hello <%= @user.parent_first  %>,

Your student, <%= @user.first_name %>, has registered to come to
<%= @camp.name %> this coming summer. Hopefully this email doesn't
come as a complete surprise! 

In order to complete the application process, we need some things
from you. 

**BE SURE TO CAREFULLY READ THIS EMAIL!** 

Important next steps to complete your student's application:
------------------------------------------------------------

Please download the document packet at <%= @url %>
this packet contains important information, and some documents 
that require signatures. 

Please fill out those documents, and sign them. They include a
signed list of permissions for who can check your student out of
camp, and our standard medical release form so that we can get
treatment for your student if they become ill at camp. 

We also require an application fee of $50. Make out a check payable
to: Southwest Speech and Debate Institute. The application fee
is non-refundable, but it will be applied to your student's tuition.

Then, place the check and the signed forms in an envelope, and 
mail them to:

SWSDI
P.O. Box 25404
Tempe AZ, 85285

When we have recieved your forms and application fee, we will
verify your student's registration is complete. We will send an 
email to notify you that the registration is verified.

We will also let you know if there is missing, or incomplete 
information that we require from you, so that you are able to
provide that information as needed.

If you have any questions, please send an email to info@swsdi.org
and one of our staff members will be delighted to help you.

We would like to thank you for sending <%= @user.first_name %> to
<%= @camp.name %>. We look forward to seeing <%= @user.first_name %>
this summer!

Cheers,
The SWSDI Staff
