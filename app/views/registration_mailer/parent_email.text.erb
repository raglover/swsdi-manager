Hello <%= @user.parent_first  %>,

Your student, <%= @user.first_name %>, has registered to come to
<%= @camp.name %> this coming summer. Hopefully this email doesn't
come as a complete surprise! 

In order to complete the application process, we need some things
from you. 

**BE SURE TO CAREFULLY READ THIS EMAIL!** 

Important next steps to complete your student's application:
------------------------------------------------------------

Please download the document packet at <%= @url %>
this packet contains important information, and some documents 
that require signatures. 

Please fill out those documents, and sign them. They include a
signed list of permissions for who can check your student out of
camp, and our standard medical release form so that we can get
treatment for your student if they become ill at camp. 

When you have finished filling out the forms, please scan them
and email to packets@swsdi.org

If you are unable to scan the documents, please paper clip (no staples!) them
together and return them via US Mail to the address below:

Adam Symonds
Arizona State University
Hugh Downs School
P.O. Box 871205
Tempe, AZ 85287

When we have recieved your forms we will
verify your student's registration is complete. We will send an 
email to notify you that the registration is verified.

We will also let you know if there is missing, or incomplete 
information that we require from you, so that you are able to
provide that information as needed.

Please Note: Your student is ALREADY ACCEPTED for camp. We are planning
to have them, and they will be included in our numbers for planning purposes.

We would also like you to download an information packet at:
<%= @docurl %>

This packet contains important information about camp, logistics, etc.
It should help answer many of your questions.

If you have any questions, please send an email to info@swsdi.org
and one of our staff members will be delighted to help you.

The next step after registration is simply arranging payment. When you recieve 
this email, you can pay by Credit/Debit card by going to <%= link_to @pay_url %>. 
If you are eligible for a discount from the ASU HDSHC Invitational in January 2022, 
or from a State tournament, please contact us at <%= mail_to 'richard+finaid@swsdi.org' %> 
for a discount code BEFORE paying via credit card. These discounts are available to students 
who made elimination rounds or finals at the ASU tournament or final rounds of State 
Championship tournaments, and are also transferrable from students who do not intend 
to use them. If you believe you are eligible for a discount on tuition, please 
include the student name, and the event in which they earned the discount. If it is a code 
transfer, please include the name of the student who is transferring their discount as well. 
When we have verified the discount, you will be emailed a discount code that you can 
use when paying on the Event site.  

We would like to thank you for sending <%= @user.first_name %> to
<%= @camp.name %>. We look forward to seeing <%= @user.first_name %>
this summer!

Cheers,
The SWSD @ ASU Staff
