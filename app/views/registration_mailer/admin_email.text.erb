A new student has registered for SWSDI!

<%= @user.first_name + " " + @user.last_name %> has submitted a camp application!

Emails have been generated and sent to the student, their parent or guardian, and
their coach. These emails include next steps to take, downloads of the relevant
documents, and a super-friendly message from us!

Be on the lookout for return packets and application fee checks!

Cheers!
