A new student has registered for SWSD!

<%= @user.first_name + " " + @user.last_name %> has submitted a camp application!

<%= @user.first_name %> has registered for the following events:

<% @app.events.each do |event| %>
    * <%= event.name %>
<% end %>

Emails have been generated and sent to the student, their parent or guardian, and
their coach. These emails include next steps to take, downloads of the relevant
documents, and a super-friendly message from us!

Be on the lookout for return packets and application fee checks!

Cheers!
