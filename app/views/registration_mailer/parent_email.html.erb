<p>
In order to complete the application process, we need some things

Please download the <%= link_to 'document packet',  @url %>

that require signatures. 
</p>
<p>
Please fill out those documents, and sign them. They include a
signed list of permissions for who can check your student out of
camp, and our standard medical release form so that we can get
treatment for your student if they become ill at camp. 
</p>
<p>
When you have finished filling out the forms, please scan them
and email to packets@swsdi.org

We will also let you know if there is missing, or incomplete 
information that we require from you, so that you are able to
provide that information as needed.

to have them, and they will be included in our numbers for planning purposes.
